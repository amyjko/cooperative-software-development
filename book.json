        "description": "This book is an introduction to the many human, social, and political aspects of software engineering. It's unique in two ways. First, unlike many software engineering books, it explictly avoids centering technical questions about software engineering, instead focusing on the many ways that software engineering work is cognitive, social, and organizational. Second, it does so by engaging extensively with academic research literature, summarizing key findings, but also questioning them, opening a dialog about the nature of software engineering work and the many factors that shape it. Anyone that reads it will be better prepared to critically engage in creating software in teams.\n\nThis book is a living document. Do you see ways to improve it?
